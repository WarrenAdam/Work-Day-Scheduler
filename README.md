# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

In this activity, the goal it to use starter code to make a work-day scheduler capable of adding, storing and changing events by hour. The work-day scheuler is useful to help users keep track of their daily events and organze their time more efficent;y and effectively. To achieve this functionality, we used javascript libraries like jQuery and Day js.


## Acceptance Criteria

This criteria was adapted from the module 5 challenge criteria on the bootcamp website.

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
